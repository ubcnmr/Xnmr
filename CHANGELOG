	Merge the pulseblaster and "mainline" versions so you build
	regular with make, and pulseblaster version with make -f Makefile-pb
	pulse programs in pb version now include pulse-pb.h

	History of pulseblaster version was sort of hidden in this (woops)
	but can be seen by checking out pulseblaster-arduino branch.
	
	
April 30, 2014.
	Imported project from cvs into git repository. 
	Imported with git cvsimport -r Oldbranches -d /usr2/src/cvsroot -C /usr/src/GIT XNMR Xnmr
	The pulseblaster branch from cvs was made by diffing the two
	branches and applying to a new pulseblaster branch in git.

	
pp0.99.4 Aug 2004
 - added add/subtract window (needs gtk+-2.4
 - fix a bunch of possible crashes on closing the scales dialog 
 - and other dialogs when closing buffers or main shutdown.

pp0.99.3
- add noise spectroscopy flag and infrastructure in acq and pulse programing library.
  If a pulse program indicates that it is a noise spectroscopy
  sequence:
  - acq will not upload data before restarting, rather it
    will do the restart and then upload.  
  - The pulse program is not recalculated or redownloaded between
    scans
  - 2d mode will do block size, but will do dummy scans before starting 
    each new block
  - The number of dummy scans will be done before
    each increment in the 2d experiment.
  - The pulse program isn't allowed to recalc every shot, only on 2d increments
  - If the timing takes too long on 2d increments, that's ok.

pp0.99.2
- changed spectrum drawing to use gdk_draw_lines which draws
  all the line segments in one call.  Much faster!
- for Redhat 9 kernel 2.4.20 signals fixed - all posix now.
- port to gtk+-2.0 - gsignal system, rewrote a few widget layouts (array popup & param frame)
- tweaked a lot of dialog positionings (set_transient_for)
- change parameter infrastructure from float to double, obsoleting double 
text type.  Text type does remain though.
- fixed up float param formatting in param file and param string.
- text params, and save name and ppname now update when they lose focus.
- fix tiny bug in pp_recompile error handling.
- lock shm's into memory.
- fixed Xnmr and Xnmr/data directory creation mode
- clean lots of little problems - closing buffer when array popup is showing 
  or press pending, or scales window open etc...
- float and text parameters are recogized if one pp has text, the other double.
Feb 20, 2003 
- added baseline spline routine
- rationalize some of the drawing and colours

pp0.99.1
- major rewrite of pulse program generation - should be way more efficient.
- going back in time now possible (store_position, jump_to_stored, return_to_present
- other???
